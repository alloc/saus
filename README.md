Bare bones SSG and SSR wrapper around Vite.

## Routes

Saus lets you implement client-side routing, but it still needs your routes so it can generate static pages at build time. Saus handles server-side routing and client-side hydration.

Add a `routes` path to your `saus.yaml` config, so Saus knows your routes. Since your routes module runs in a Node environment, it's recommended to create a `./src/node` folder and keep your routes in there.

```yml
# saus.yaml
routes: ./src/node/routes.ts
```

Routes are defined with the `defineRoutes` function. At a bare minimum, each route needs a function that uses dynamic `import()` to load its root component.

```ts
import { defineRoutes } from 'saus'

defineRoutes({
  '/': () => import('./pages/Home'),
})
```

Routes are matched in reverse order (except the `default` route, of course).

### Route Parameters

If your route's path has parameters and you want to generate static pages at build time, you'll want to define a `query` function as well. Saus uses [regexparam](https://github.com/lukeed/regexparam#readme) to implement route parameters.

The `query` function must return an array of strings (or a promise thereof) that fills in the parameters of your route's path. Each string represents a statically generated page.

```ts
import { defineRoutes } from 'saus'
import fs from 'fs-extra'

defineRoutes({
  '/posts/:id': {
    import: () => import('./pages/Post'),
    query: () => fs.readJson('./data/posts.json').map(json => json.postId),
  },
})
```

### Default Route

When no matching route is found, Saus uses the default route (if you define one).

```ts
import { defineRoutes } from 'saus'

defineRoutes({
  default: () => import('./pages/404'),
})
```

### Client Routing

Saus provides a basic `routes` object for client-side routing. It's your responsibility to implement client-side routing that fits your needs.

```ts
import { routes } from 'saus/client'

const module = await routes['/']()
```

## Rendering

Saus is unopinionated about your view framework. Instead, it has a concept called a "renderer", whose logic should be isomorphic (meaning it can run in both Node and web environments).

First, tell Saus where to find your render module.

```yml
# saus.yaml
render: ./src/render.tsx
```

Define a Saus renderer by calling the `render` function in your render module. It takes an optional route path as its first argument. If no route path is given, you've defined the default renderer.

```ts
import { render, escape } from 'saus'

// NaÃ¯ve renderer that expects "module.default" to be an HTML string.
render(async (module, params, state) => {
  return escape`<div>${module.default}</div>`
})
```

Renderers receive the following arguments:

- `module` is loaded with the `import` function of the matching route
- `params` is an object of route parameters
- `state` is a JSON object that is sent to the client

Mutate the `state` object with any data you'll need to hydrate the page. By default, it includes the `routeModuleId` (the URL for the `module` argument) and the `routeParams` (same as the `params` argument). Your state is made available on the client-side.

```ts
import { state } from 'saus/client'

console.log(state)
```

Renderers are matched in reverse order (except for the default renderer, of course).

### Renderer Packages

Your view framework of choice might have a `@saus/*` package you can use.

In the case of `@saus/react`, client hydration works out-of-the-box. The `div#root` element is created and hydrated with `ReactDOM.hydrate` automatically.

```tsx
import { render } from '@saus/react'

render(async (module, params, state) => {
  const Page = module.default
  return (
    <html>
      <head>
        <title>My App</title>
      </head>
      <body>
        <Page {...params} />
      </body>
    </html>
  )
}).then(() => {
  // An isomorphic post-render effect.
  // This runs after HTML is generated on the server,
  // and after hydration on the client.
})
```

### Custom Renderer

That said, you can integrate unsupported frameworks easily.

```tsx
import {escape, render} from 'saus'

render(async (route, params, module) => {
  return escape`<html>${...}</html>`
})
```

## Developing

Run `saus dev` to start a Vite dev server with saus plugins injected.

## Building

Run `saus build` to generate pages.
