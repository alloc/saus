You specify the value in one of two formats, depending on whether you want to access the source object through an access point:   For objects not accessed through an access point, specify the name of the source bucket and the key of the source object, separated by a slash (/). For example, to copy the object reports/january.pdf from the bucket awsexamplebucket, use awsexamplebucket/reports/january.pdf. The value must be URL-encoded.   For objects accessed through access points, specify the Amazon Resource Name (ARN) of the object as accessed through the access point, in the format arn:aws:s3:&lt;Region&gt;:&lt;account-id&gt;:accesspoint/&lt;access-point-name&gt;/object/&lt;key&gt;. For example, to copy the object reports/january.pdf through access point my-access-point owned by account 123456789012 in Region us-west-2, use the URL encoding of arn:aws:s3:us-west-2:123456789012:accesspoint/my-access-point/object/reports/january.pdf. The value must be URL encoded.  Amazon S3 supports copy operations using access points only when the source and destination buckets are in the same Amazon Web Services Region.

When you request an object (GetObject) or object metadata (HeadObject) from these buckets, Amazon S3 will return the x-amz-replication-status header in the response as follows:    If requesting an object from the source bucket, Amazon S3 will return the x-amz-replication-status header if the object in your request is eligible for replication.  For example, suppose that in your replication configuration, you specify object prefix TaxDocs requesting Amazon S3 to replicate objects with key prefix TaxDocs. Any objects you upload with this key name prefix, for example TaxDocs/document1.pdf, are eligible for replication. For any object request with this key name prefix, Amazon S3 will return the x-amz-replication-status header with value PENDING, COMPLETED or FAILED indicating object replication status.

When replicating objects to multiple destination buckets, the x-amz-replication-status header acts differently.

     * Specifies the source object for the copy operation. You specify the value in one of two formats, depending on whether you want to access the source object through an access point:   For objects not accessed through an access point, specify the name of the source bucket and key of the source object, separated by a slash (/). For example, to copy the object reports/january.pdf from the bucket awsexamplebucket, use awsexamplebucket/reports/january.pdf. The value must be URL-encoded.   For objects accessed through access points, specify the Amazon Resource Name (ARN) of the object as accessed through the access point, in the format arn:aws:s3:&lt;Region&gt;:&lt;account-id&gt;:accesspoint/&lt;access-point-name&gt;/object/&lt;key&gt;. For example, to copy the object reports/january.pdf through access point my-access-point owned by account 123456789012 in Region us-west-2, use the URL encoding of arn:aws:s3:us-west-2:123456789012:accesspoint/my-access-point/object/reports/january.pdf. The value must be URL encoded.  Amazon S3 supports copy operations using access points only when the source and destination buckets are in the same Amazon Web Services Region.  Alternatively, for objects accessed through Amazon S3 on Outposts, specify the ARN of the object as accessed in the format arn:aws:s3-outposts:&lt;Region&gt;:&lt;account-id&gt;:outpost/&lt;outpost-id&gt;/object/&lt;key&gt;. For example, to copy the object reports/january.pdf through outpost my-outpost owned by account 123456789012 in Region us-west-2, use the URL encoding of arn:aws:s3-outposts:us-west-2:123456789012:outpost/my-outpost/object/reports/january.pdf. The value must be URL-encoded.    To copy a specific version of an object, append ?versionId=&lt;version-id&gt; to the value (for example, awsexamplebucket/reports/january.pdf?versionId=QUpfdndhfd8438MNFDN93jdnJFkdmqnh893). If you don't specify a version ID, Amazon S3 copies the latest version of the source object.
